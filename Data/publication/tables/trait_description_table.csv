UMCC - X-axis,UKUX,Berry Shape Chimera Parameters,,log of Unsigned Manhattan Chain Code - X-axis.  Larger values indicate more change in berry curvature.,
UMCC - Y-axis,UKUY,Berry Shape Chimera Parameters,,log of Unsigned Manhattan Chain Code - Y-axis.  Larger values indicate more change in berry curvature.,
Eccentricity,UKEC,Berry Shape Chimera Parameters,,"Mathematical eccentricity of derived berry chimera shape.  Circular berries have 0 eccentricity, elliptical berries have larger eccentricities the more oblong the berry is, but less than 1.",
Length vs. Width,UKLvW,Berry Shape Chimera Parameters,,The derived berry chimera shape length versus width ratio.,
Tortuosity,UKTO,Berry Shape Chimera Parameters,,The derived berry chimera shape tortuosity.  Larger values indicate increased ‘waviness’ in the berry contour.  Smoother/rounder berries will have lower values. ,
Solidity,UKSO,Berry Shape Chimera Parameters,,"The derived berry chimera shape density relative to it’s convex hull.  Lower values indicate more ‘waviness’ in the berry contour, while higher values have smoother contour curvature.",
