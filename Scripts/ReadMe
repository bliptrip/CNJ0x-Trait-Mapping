The following scripts and data files are associated with collecting and collating the original phenotype datasets for the CNJ populations:
- collate_all_accessions.sh
- collate_separate_excel_datasets.py
- collate_datasets.txt

The following script fills in the appropriate NJ accession designator in the collated dataset using an appropriate source file that maps these accessions.
- fill_accessions.py

The following script fills in the population numbers in an excel spreadsheet of the NJ data, but this role has been taken over by the collate_separate_excel_datasets.pycollate_separate_excel_datasets.py
script:
- change_population_numbers.py

The following script takes a random subset of collated workbook for analysis (I was using it to cross-check against entries in notebooks):
- random_subset.py

Makefile: Builds the collated dataset and automates some of the other script running.
- Targets:
    - compile: Builds the collated dataset and fills in the appropriate NJ accessions.
    - fill_accession: Fills in the appropriate NJ accession using a map file.
    - collate: Builds the collated dataset from the original spreadsheet files.
    - subset: Takes a random subset from the large collated dataset file.
