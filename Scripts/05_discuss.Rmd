For CNJ02 population:

Tacy and PAC inversely correlated with SFY and positively correlated with PFR could mean that fruit rot is undesirably 
linked with higher levels of Tacy/PAC (desirable traits), or could simply be an indicator that these genotypes undergo 
berry development and ripening sooner than the others (since everything harvested at the same time).  A few additional
indicators of this relationship between sound fruit yield and Tacy/PAC can be found in the modestly negative
correlations of *SFY × PAC* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['SFY','PAC']`$), *SFY × Tacy* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['SFY','Tacy']`$), 
*UNAB × PAC* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['UNAB','PAC']`$), *MFM × PAC* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['MFM','PAC']`$), 
*MFM × UNAF* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['MFM','UNAF']`$), and *MFM × UBBL* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['MFM','UBBL']`$).

Compared to CNJ02, CNJ04 has  weaker correlations for traits
*UBM x UBW* (`r p.cnj04.c['UBM','UBW']` vs. `r p.cnj02.c['UBM','UBW']`) and *UBM × UBL* (`r p.cnj04.c['UBM','UBL']` vs. `r p.cnj02.c['UBM','UBL']`). - Due to less variation/segregation in width and length 
in berries found in CNJ04?  Look at BLUP and trait summary stats tables

Comment and conjecture on noteworthy correlations discussed in results:

For CNJ04, there appears to be a modest negative correlation between berry size and Brix.  This could represent some
form of linkage drag in this population, as seen in other progeny derived from a Steven's parent (Sweetie, progeny of a
cross of Stevens × Ben Lear).


*UCLP x UCLS* is interesting in that calyx lobe fold pattern could have more to do developmentally with calyx lobe size
(pleiotropy), or the genes are strongly linked.

It would be interesting to compare differential fruit coloring/Tacy with differential fruit rot (check out Luis' paper)
-- this could allow us to decouple ripening stage from negatively linked sound fruit yield with Tacy/PAC levels.

##Heritabilities

High heritability of berry length in both populations would seem to indicate that this would be a good way of selecting
for larger berries.  Even higher heritabilities in berry length vs. width indicates that this is a great trait to breed
for when selecting for particular berry shape characteristics important for processing (rounder berries preferred).  If
it is possible to select genotypes with larger berry length and low LvW, along with low rot rates, this could be a good
way to produce genotypes with good processing abilities.

Evidence of very low heritabilities in traits such as *Brix* and *TA* in population CNJ02 over CNJ04 could simply
indicate less genetic variation for these traits in CNJ02, but the baseline could be higher -- show a figure of 
inter-population BLUPS side-by-side to get a good perspective on the absolute amount of selectable additive genetic variation 
b/w populations.
