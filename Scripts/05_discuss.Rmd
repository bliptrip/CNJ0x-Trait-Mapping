For CNJ02 population:

Tacy and PAC inversely correlated with SFY and positively correlated with PFR could mean that fruit rot is undesirably 
linked with higher levels of Tacy/PAC (desirable traits), or could simply be an indicator that these genotypes undergo 
berry development and ripening sooner than the others (since everything harvested at the same time).  A few additional
indicators of this relationship between sound fruit yield and Tacy/PAC can be found in the modestly negative
correlations of *SFY × PAC* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['SFY','PAC']`$), *SFY × Tacy* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['SFY','Tacy']`$), 
*UNAB × PAC* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['UNAB','PAC']`$), *MFM × PAC* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['MFM','PAC']`$), 
*MFM × UNAF* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['MFM','UNAF']`$), and *MFM × UBBL* ($\rho =  `r p.cnj02.c['MFM','UBBL']`$).

Compared to CNJ02, CNJ04 has  weaker correlations for traits
*UBM x UBW* (`r p.cnj04.c['UBM','UBW']` vs. `r p.cnj02.c['UBM','UBW']`) and *UBM × UBL* (`r p.cnj04.c['UBM','UBL']` vs. `r p.cnj02.c['UBM','UBL']`). - Due to less variation/segregation in width and length 
in berries found in CNJ04?  Look at BLUP and trait summary stats tables

Comment and conjecture on noteworthy correlations discussed in results:

For CNJ04, there appears to be a modest negative correlation between berry size and Brix.  This could represent some
form of linkage drag in this population, as seen in other progeny derived from a Steven's parent (Sweetie, progeny of a
cross of Stevens × Ben Lear).


*UCLP x UCLS* is interesting in that calyx lobe fold pattern could have more to do developmentally with calyx lobe size
(pleiotropy), or the genes are strongly linked.

It would be interesting to compare differential fruit coloring/Tacy with differential fruit rot (check out Luis' paper)
-- this could allow us to decouple ripening stage from negatively linked sound fruit yield with Tacy/PAC levels.

##Heritabilities

High heritability of berry length in both populations would seem to indicate that this would be a good way of selecting
for larger berries.  Even higher heritabilities in berry length vs. width indicates that this is a great trait to breed
for when selecting for particular berry shape characteristics important for processing (rounder berries preferred).  If
it is possible to select genotypes with larger berry length and low LvW, along with low rot rates, this could be a good
way to produce genotypes with good processing abilities.

Evidence of very low heritabilities in traits such as *Brix* and *TA* in population CNJ02 over CNJ04 could simply
indicate less genetic variation for these traits in CNJ02, but the baseline could be higher -- show a figure of 
inter-population BLUPS side-by-side to get a good perspective on the absolute amount of selectable additive genetic variation 
b/w populations.

##QTLs

- Make a comment that smaller population size of CNJ04 could result in overfitting, and hence the higher average model
  fits than in CNJ02 (almost 17% higher!)
- CNJ02
    - Mention that the largest set of collocated QTLs on LG 3 is intriguing, b/c one of them is derived from an entirely
      different set of data (plot data -- plot mean fruit weigth) versus the upright mean fruit weight data.  Shows
      overlap b/w datasets (check to see how UMFM and MFM correlate)
- For CNJ04, although a lower LvW ratio is preferred for rounder berries, selecting for this could result in smaller
  berries by dragging in berries with shorter lengths.  Thus, it would make sense to select for berries with larger
  widths to offset this trend.  Although the heritability of berry width is such that it is not displayed in table
  \@ref(tab:qtl-table-cnj04-sw) because its heritability (0.48) is just below the cutoff of 0.5, lg 9 pos 64.23cM shows
  a modestly positive effect for genotype *AD*.  Since it is on a separate linkage group from the primary QTL for upright *berry
  length* (lg 11), it is easy to select for berries with larger widths and lower lengths without worrying about linkage
  drag.  Also note that CNJ04 much more explicit variation in berry length compared to width, so it is more difficult
  to select for rounder berries without negatively impacting berry size, and thus yield.  Upright *total berry
weight* does not even share its top 2 QTL with the same linkage groups as *total yield*, but given that the intertrait
correlation between them in insignificant, it is not surprising that they do not share QTLs.
