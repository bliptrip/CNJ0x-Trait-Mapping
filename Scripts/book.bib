Convenient methods for computing BLUE of the estimable linear functions of the fixed elements of the model and for computing best linear unbiased predictions of the random elements of the model have been available. Most data available to animal breeders, however, do not meet the usual requirements of random sampling, the problem being that the data arise either from selection experiments or from breeders' herds which are undergoing selection. Consequently, the usual methods are likely to yield biased estimates and predictions. Methods for dealing with such data are presented in this paper.},

abstract = {Breeding efforts in the American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.), a North American perennial fruit crop of great importance, have been hampered by the limited genetic and phenotypic variability observed among cultivars and experimental materials. Most of the cultivars commercially used by cranberry growers today were derived from a few wild accessions bred in the 1950s. In different crops, wild germplasm has been used as an important genetic resource to incorporate novel traits and increase the phenotypic diversity of breeding materials. Vaccinium microcarpum (Turcz. ex Rupr.) Schmalh. and V. oxycoccos L., two closely related species, may be cross-compatible with the American cranberry, and could be useful to improve fruit quality such as phytochemical content. Furthermore, given their northern distribution, they could also help develop cold hardy cultivars. Although these species have previously been analyzed in diversity studies, genomic characterization and comparative studies are still lacking. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the organelle genomes of the cultivated American cranberry and its wild relative, V. microcarpum. PacBio sequencing technology allowed us to assemble both mitochondrial and plastid genomes at very high coverage and in a single circular scaffold. A comparative analysis revealed that the mitochondrial genome sequences were identical between both species and that the plastids presented only two synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Moreover, the Illumina resequencing of additional accessions of V. microcarpum and V. oxycoccos revealed high genetic variation in both species. Based on these results, we provided a hypothesis involving the extension and dynamics of the last glaciation period in North America, and how this could have shaped the distribution and dispersal of V. microcarpum. Finally, we provided important data regarding the polyploid origin of V. oxycoccos.},

abstract = {Many important traits in plant breeding are polygenic and therefore recalcitrant to traditional marker-assisted selection. Genomic selection addresses this complexity by including all markers in the prediction model. A key method for the genomic prediction of breeding values is ridge regression (RR), which is equivalent to best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) when the genetic covariance between lines is proportional to their similarity in genotype space. This additive model can be broadened to include epistatic effects by using other kernels, such as the Gaussian, which represent inner products in a complex feature space. To facilitate the use of RR and nonadditive kernels in plant breeding, a new software package for R called rrBLUP has been developed. At its core is a fast maximum-likelihood algorithm for mixed models with a single variance component besides the residual error, which allows for efficient prediction with unreplicated training data. Use of the rrBLUP software is demonstrated through several examples, including the identification of optimal crosses based on superior progeny value. In cross-validation tests, the prediction accuracy with nonadditive kernels was significantly higher than RR for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield but equivalent for several maize (Zea mays L.) traits.},

abstract = {The first genetic map of cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) has been constructed, comprising 14 linkage groups totaling 879.9 cM with an estimated coverage of 82.2 %. This map, based on four mapping populations segregating for field fruit-rot resistance, contains 136 distinct loci. Mapped markers include blueberry-derived simple sequence repeat (SSR) and cranberry-derived sequence-characterized amplified region markers previously used for fingerprinting cranberry cultivars. In addition, SSR markers were developed near cranberry sequences resembling genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis or defense against necrotrophic pathogens, or conserved orthologous set (COS) sequences. The cranberry SSRs were developed from next-generation cranberry genomic sequence assemblies; thus, the positions of these SSRs on the genomic map provide information about the genomic location of the sequence scaffold from which they were derived. The use of SSR markers near COS and other functional sequences, plus 33 SSR markers from blueberry, facilitates comparisons of this map with maps of other plant species. Regions of the cranberry map were identified that showed conservation of synteny with Vitis vinifera and Arabidopsis thaliana. Positioned on this map are quantitative trait loci (QTL) for field fruit-rot resistance (FFRR), fruit weight, titratable acidity, and sound fruit yield (SFY). The SFY QTL is adjacent to one of the fruit weight QTL and may reflect pleiotropy. Two of the FFRR QTL are in regions of conserved synteny with grape and span defense gene markers, and the third FFRR QTL spans a flavonoid biosynthetic gene.},

- paper details construction of first genetic map of cranberry, comparison to At and Vv, and id of QTL for FFRR, fruit weight, TA, and SFY
- uses markers used previously for id'ing genotypes and diversity studies, along with new SSR markers xfered from blueberry (SOLiD) and newly derived ones (SOLiD)
- three parents exhibiting FFRR, three susceptible cultivars (Stevens, #35, ...) were 4-crossed to produce 182 progeny
- none of individual population sizes are large, but represent 'single-round-robin partial diallel design)
- combined analysis can be performed to increase power to detect QTLs, or emphasize that QTLs found are more generalizable
- * could apply to populations we have that share common parents, although not sure if combined analysis with inbred parents -> F2 are generalizable to highly heterozygous parents - they reference the paper "Using mating designs to uncover QTL and the genetic architecture of complex traits KJF"

- use Kruskall-Wallis (rank-based, nonparametric, unbalanced version of ANOVA) to look for significant effects at markers on phenotypes that are categorical
- use IM and MQM (multiple qtl model) to hunt for QTL at intervals b/w markers and to model some previously found QTLs as cofactors in analysis},

The exploitation of genome-assisted approaches could greatly benefit breeding efforts in American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) and other minor crops. Using biparental populations with different degrees of relatedness, we evaluated multiple GS methods for total yield (TY) and mean fruit weight (MFW). Specifically, we compared predictive ability (PA) differences between univariate and multivariate genomic best linear unbiased predictors (GBLUP and MGBLUP, respectively). We found that MGBLUP provided higher predictive ability (PA) than GBLUP, in scenarios with medium genetic correlation (8–17% increase with corg$\sim$0.6) and high genetic correlations (25–156% with corg$\sim$0.9), but found no increase when genetic correlation was low. In addition, we found that only a few hundred single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are needed to reach a plateau in PA for both traits in the biparental populations studied (in full linkage disequilibrium). We observed that higher resemblance among individuals in the training (TP) and validation (VP) populations provided greater PA. Although multivariate GS methods are available, genetic correlations and other factors need to be carefully considered when applying these methods for genetic improvement.},

Moreover, only four complete Asterid mitochondrial genomes have been made publicly available. The cranberry mitochondrial genome was assembled and reconstructed from whole genome 454 Roche GS-FLX and Illumina shotgun sequences. Compared with other Asterids, the reconstruction of the genome revealed an average size mitochondrion (459,678 nt) with relatively little repetitive sequences and DNA of plastid origin. The complete mitochondrial genome of cranberry was annotated obtaining a total of 34 genes classified based on their putative function, plus three ribosomal RNAs, and 17 transfer RNAs. Maternal organellar cranberry inheritance was inferred by analyzing gene variation in the cranberry mitochondria and plastid genomes. The annotation of cranberry mitochondrial genome revealed the presence of two copies of tRNA-Sec and a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element which were lost in plants during evolution. This is the first report of a land plant possessing selenocysteine insertion machinery at the sequence level.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The application of genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approaches, combined with data imputation methodologies, is narrowing the genetic knowledge gap between major and understudied, minor crops. GBS is an excellent tool to characterize the genomic structure of recently domesticated ($\sim$200 years) and understudied species, such as cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.), by generating large numbers of markers for genomic studies such as genetic mapping.\n\nRESULTS: We identified 10842 potentially mappable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a cranberry pseudo-testcross population wherein 5477 SNPs and 211 short sequence repeats (SSRs) were used to construct a high density linkage map in cranberry of which a total of 4849 markers were mapped. Recombination frequency, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and segregation distortion at the genomic level in the parental and integrated linkage maps were characterized for first time in cranberry. SSR markers, used as the backbone in the map, revealed high collinearity with previously published linkage maps. The 4849 point map consisted of twelve linkage groups spanning 1112 cM, which anchored 2381 nuclear scaffolds accounting for $\sim$13 Mb of the estimated 470 Mb cranberry genome. Bin mapping identified 592 and 672 unique bins in the parentals and a total of 1676 unique marker positions in the integrated map. Synteny analyses comparing the order of anchored cranberry scaffolds to their homologous positions in kiwifruit, grape, and coffee genomes provided initial evidence of homology between cranberry and closely related species.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: GBS data was used to rapidly saturate the cranberry genome with markers in a pseudo-testcross population. Collinearity between the present saturated genetic map and previous cranberry SSR maps suggests that the SNP locations represent accurate marker order and chromosome structure of the cranberry genome. SNPs greatly improved current marker genome coverage, which allowed for genome-wide structure investigations such as segregation distortion, recombination, linkage disequilibrium, and synteny analyses. In the future, GBS can be used to accelerate cranberry molecular breeding through QTL mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS).},

abstract = {Since its domestication 200 years ago, breeding of the American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) has relied on phenotypic selection because applicable resources for molecular improvement strategies such as marker-assisted selection (MAS) remain limited. To enable MAS in cranberry, the first high-density SSR linkage map with 541 markers representing all 12 cranberry chromosomes was constructed for the CNJ02-1 progeny from a cross of elite cultivars, CNJ97-105-4 and NJ98-23. The population was phenotyped for a 3-year period for total yield (TY), mean fruit weight (MFW), and biennial bearing index (BBI), and data were analyzed using mixed models and best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs). Significant differences between genotypes were observed for all traits. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses using BLUPs identified four MFW QTL on three linkage groups (LGs), three TY QTL on three LGs, and one BBI QTL which co-localized with a TY QTL. Local BLAST of a cranberry nuclear genome assembly identified homologous sequences for the mapped SSRs which were then anchored to 12 pseudo-chromosomes using the linkage map information. Analyses comparing coding regions (CDS) anchored in the cranberry linkage map with grape, kiwifruit, and tomato genomes were performed. Moderate micro-synteny between the cranberry and kiwifruit genomes was detected, although none of the regions overlapped with the QTL identified in this study. The linkage map, QTL, and elite genotypic constitutions identified herein may be applied in subsequent cranberry MAS programs for the development of new cultivars, and potential marker transferability should allow for comparative genomic studies within economically important Vaccinium species.},
annote = {- are the two 'independent' TY samples sufficiently independent to be considered reps? I see that Brandon modeled a G:Y and B:Y effect to look at interactions, which requires repetitions of genotypes to calculate, but need to rethink this.
- virtual blocking concept is interesting - b/c of replication of alleles in full-sib family in randomized design, and fact that expect 'virtual' blocks of genotypes to resemble each other
- upon assessment of all possible 'virtual' blocking designs, relative inefficiencies assessed to dtermine optimal incomplete blocking design (as is done in uniformity trial) - to account for observed trends in phenotypic spatial variation
- My Notes: probably another interesting way to handle this is to choose virutal, contiguous blocks that contain the lowest level of inter-block genetic variation but high within-block genetic variation (uniformity representation of alleles across all blocks) and then map phenotypic trends across these blocks -- is this what this is doing? - Ask Luis about this.
- used MapQTL for estimating QTLs from BLUPS/year-specific BLUPs
- fascinating discussion around the relationship b/w Total Yield:Year interaction effects and how these play into biennial-bearing indices -- if you have a very low bienniel-bearing characteristic for a given genotype, then the yield:year interaction effect should be low and not significant.
- do some more research into how Brandon defined his models when calculating BLUPS, and determining which effects were significant (in the case of significant genotype:year effects, he then looked at QTLs b/w years)
- Consider doing something like Brandon did, but use PC's to see how my traits are related and how they best separate differences b/w genotypes.},

abstract = {The color of berry skin is an important economic trait for grape and is essentially determined by the components and content of anthocyanins. The fruit color of Chinese wild grapes is generally black, and the profile of anthocyanins in Chinese wild grapes is significantly different from that of Vitis vinifera. However, V. davidii is the only species that possesses white berry varieties among Chinese wild grape species. Thus, we performed a transcriptomic analysis to compare the difference of transcriptional level in black and white V. davidii, in order to find some key genes that are related to anthocyanins accumulation in V. davidii. The results of anthocyanins detection revealed that 3,5-O-diglucoside anthocyanins is the predominant anthocyanins in V. davidii. It showed obvious differences from V. vinifera in the profile of the composition of anthocyanins. The transcriptome sequencing by Illumina mRNA-Seq technology generated an average of 57 million 100-base pair clean reads from each sample. Differential gene expression analysis revealed thousands of differential expression genes (DEGs) in the pairwise comparison of different fruit developmental stages between and within black and white V. davidii. After the analysis of functional category enrichment and differential expression patterns of DEGs, 46 genes were selected as the candidate genes. Some genes have been reported as being related to anthocyanins accumulation, and some genes were newly found in our study as probably being related to anthocyanins accumulation. We inferred that 3AT (VIT_03s0017g00870) played an important role in anthocyanin acylation, GST4 (VIT_04s0079g00690) and AM2 (VIT_16s0050g00910) played important roles in anthocyanins transport in V. davidii. The expression of some selected DEGs was further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The present study investigated the transcriptomic profiles of berry skin from black and white spine grapes at three fruit developmental stages by Illumina mRNA-Seq technology. It revealed the variety specificity of anthocyanins accumulation in V. davidi at the transcriptional level. The data reported here will provide a valuable resource for understanding anthocyanins accumulation in grapes, especially in V. davidii.},

abstract = {Whole-genome regression methods are being increasingly used for the analysis and prediction of complex traits and diseases. In human genetics, these methods are commonly used for inferences about genetic parameters, such as the amount of genetic variance among individuals or the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by regression on molecular markers. This is so even though some of the assumptions commonly adopted for data analysis are at odds with important quantitative genetic concepts. In this article we develop theory that leads to a precise definition of parameters arising in high dimensional genomic regressions; we focus on the so-called genomic heritability: the proportion of variance of a trait that can be explained (in the population) by a linear regression on a set of markers. We propose a definition of this parameter that is framed within the classical quantitative genetics theory and show that the genomic heritability and the trait heritability parameters are equal only when all causal variants are typed. Further, we discuss how the genomic variance and genomic heritability, defined as quantitative genetic parameters, relate to parameters of statistical models commonly used for inferences, and indicate potential inferential problems that are assessed further using simulations. When a large proportion of the markers used in the analysis are in LE with QTL the likelihood function can be misspecified. This can induce a sizable finite-sample bias and, possibly, lack of consistency of likelihood (or Bayesian) estimates. This situation can be encountered if the individuals in the sample are distantly related and linkage disequilibrium spans over short regions. This bias does not negate the use of whole-genome regression models as predictive machines; however, our results indicate that caution is needed when using marker-based regressions for inferences about population parameters such as the genomic heritability.},
annote = {- This paper details the mathematical foundations of the definition of hg^2, or genomic heritability

- some discussion around WGR, or whole-genome-regression methods, and how increased density and availability of marker data has allowed inference of genetic values from marker data -- but there is little underlying understanding how this relates to true genetic value (and additive genetic variance)

- availability of genotype info on large number of loci has made possible to assess kinship of nom. unrelated individuals -- due to imperfect LD b/w markers and QTL, patterns of allele sharing at markers and causal loci may be very different

- distinction must be made b/w data gen. process and model used for data analysis

- instrumental regression model - genotype info at markers used in place of causal genotypes that are basis of classical model of quantitative genetic 
theory

- 'missing heritability' - proportion of unexplained genetic variance - conceptually attributed to imperfect LD b/w markers and QTL

- in classical quantitative genetics theory, genetic variance stems from variation at QTL alleles/genotypes - effects of allele on trait are fixed quantities
- on other hand, instrumental regression model - gentoypes are fixed and variation stems from uncertainty about marker effects

- purpose of paper - establish theory aiming at precise def. of params arising in regression models using genomic data, using classical quantitative genetics as foundation

Classical Quantitative Genetics Theory
- genetic value - expected phenotypic value given QTL
- genetic variance - average (over individuals) squared deviation of the genetic values from the population mean
- additive effects of the QTL - effects of allelic substitutions, defined as regression of gi (genetic value) on zi (allelic scores on QTL)

Instrumental Model (regression on markers)
- usually set of genes affecting complex trait is unknown
- empirical linear regression models are fitted using markers whose alleles are typically in imperfect LD with the causative QTL
- marker additive genetic value can be defined as regression of true genetic value on allelic content at marker loci
- residual - components of true additive genetic values, that, due to imperfect marker-QTL LD, cannot be explained by regression on markers
- genomic variance depends on QTL effects and on LD relationships among QTL and markers
- genomic heritability -- genomic variance over additive genetic variance = squared correlation b/w marker genotypes and QTL
- w/ sequence data, all 'causal variants' are expected to be included in makrer panel, and therefore vector of marker effects == vector of genetic (QTL) effects - genomic and trait heritability coincide
- does not imply that estimators converge in probability to the true pop. params},

abstract = {The American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) is one of only three widely-cultivated fruit crops native to North America- the other two are blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) and native grape (Vitis spp.). In terms of taxonomy, cranberries are in the core Ericales, an order for which genome sequence data are currently lacking. In addition, cranberries produce a host of important polyphenolic secondary compounds, some of which are beneficial to human health. Whereas next-generation sequencing technology is allowing the advancement of whole-genome sequencing, one major obstacle to the successful assembly from short-read sequence data of complex diploid (and higher ploidy) organisms is heterozygosity. Cranberry has the advantage of being diploid (2n =2x = 24) and self-fertile. To minimize the issue of heterozygosity, we sequenced the genome of a fifth-generation inbred genotype (F ≥ 0.97) derived from five generations of selfing originating from the cultivar Ben Lear.

The fruit size and shape of American cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpon L.) are particularly important characteristics that determine the harvests' processing value and potential end-use products (e.g., juice vs. sweetened dried cranberries). However, cranberry fruit size and shape attributes can be difficult and time consuming for breeders and processors to measure, especially when relying on manual measurements and visual ratings. Therefore, in this study, we implemented image-based phenotyping techniques for gathering data regarding basic cranberry fruit parameters such as length, width, length-to-width ratio, and eccentricity. Additionally, we applied a persistent homology algorithm to better characterize complex shape parameters. Using this high-throughput artificial vision approach, we characterized fruit from 351 progeny from a full-sib cranberry population over three field seasons. Using a covariate analysis to maximize the identification of well-supported quantitative trait loci (QTL), we found 252 single QTL in a 3-year period for cranberry fruit size and shape descriptors from which 20% were consistently found in all years. The present study highlights the potential for the identified QTL and the image-based methods to serve as a basis for future explorations of the genetic architecture of fruit size and shape in cranberry and other fruit crops.},

abstract = {Background: Nested association mapping (NAM) is a novel genetic mating design that combines the advantages of linkage analysis and association mapping. This design provides opportunities to study the inheritance of complex traits, but also requires more advanced statistical methods. In this paper, we present the detailed algorithm of a QTL linkage mapping method suitable for genetic populations derived from NAM designs. This method is called joint inclusive composite interval mapping (JICIM). Simulations were designed on the detected QTL in a maize NAM population and an Arabidopsis NAM population so as to evaluate the efficiency of the NAM design and the JICIM method. Principal Findings: Fifty-two QTL were identified in the maize population, explaining 89% of the phenotypic variance of days to silking, and nine QTL were identified in the Arabidopsis population, explaining 83% of the phenotypic variance of flowering time. Simulations indicated that the detection power of these identified QTL was consistently high, especially for large-effect QTL. For rare QTL having significant effects in only one family, the power of correct detection within the 5 cM support interval was around 80% for 1-day effect QTL in the maize population, and for 3-day effect QTL in the Arabidopsis population. For smaller-effect QTL, the power diminished, e.g., it was around 50% for maize QTL with an effect of 0.5 day. When QTL were linked at a distance of 5 cM, the likelihood of mapping them as two distinct QTL was about 70% in the maize population. When the linkage distance was 1 cM, they were more likely mapped as one single QTL at an intermediary position. Conclusions: Because it takes advantage of the large genetic variation among parental lines and the large population size, NAM is a powerful multiple-cross design for complex trait dissection. JICIM is an efficient and specialty method for the joint QTL linkage mapping of genetic populations derived from the NAM design.},

- Could be useful in analyzing some of our cranberry populations that have a common parent
- Two step process to find joint inclusive composite interval mapping (JICIM)
- first step: estimate population effect + population x marker effect
- second step: subtract above effects from phenotypes for respective population and respective marker, and then execute one-dimensional scanning similar to inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM)
- phenotype of a given QTL assumed to follow a mixture distribution assuming two different normals for assumed two homozygous states in QTL region - and likelihood is calculated from this

abstract = {Sustainability of the cranberry industry is threatened by widespread and increasing losses due to fruit rot in the field as well as increasing restrictions on fungicide inputs. Breeding for resistance offers a partial solution but is challenging because fruit rot is caused by a complex of pathogenic fungi that can vary by location and from year to year. We identified four genetically diverse germplasm accessions that exhibit broad-spectrum fruit rot resistance under field conditions. Three of these accessions were used in biparental crosses to develop four populations segregating for resistance. Genotyping by sequencing was used to generate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for development of high-density genetic maps and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses. Nineteen QTL associated with fruit rot resistance, distributed on nine linkage groups, were discovered in our populations. Three of these QTL matched previously reported fruit rot resistance QTL. Four newly reported QTL found on linkage group 8 (Vm8), which explain between 21 and 33% of the phenotypic variance for fruit rot, are of particular interest to our breeding program. The populations described herein were also phenotyped for other horticulturally important traits, and QTL associated with yield and berry weight were identified.
