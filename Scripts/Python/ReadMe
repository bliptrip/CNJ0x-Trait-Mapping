The following scripts and data files are associated with collecting and collating the original phenotype datasets for the CNJ populations:
- collate_all_accessions.sh
- collate_separate_excel_datasets.py
- collate_datasets.txt

The following script fills in the appropriate NJ accession designator in the collated dataset using an appropriate source file that maps these accessions.
- fill_accessions.py

The following script fills in the population numbers in an excel spreadsheet of the NJ data, but this role has been taken over by the collate_separate_excel_datasets.pycollate_separate_excel_datasets.py
script:
- change_population_numbers.py

The following script takes a random subset of collated workbook for analysis (I was using it to cross-check against entries in notebooks):
- random_subset.py

The following script finds and highlights in red the differences between the combined curated dataset from Jenny Bolivar and our raw collated datafile:
- compare_raw_collate_to_precurate.sh

The following script backcopies edted/curated entries in the downstream collated file back to the original raw datasets.
- compare_raw_collate_to_precurate.sh

The following script simply generates a raw difference output between two input excel spreadsheets, although it has been modified to really only work with the raw phenotype files.
- diff_spreadsheets.py

The following script will generate a set of difference fils between the original, uncurated raw phenotype files and the hand-curated phenotype files.
- diff_all_spreadsheets.sh
- diff_all_spreadhseets.txt - a file containing the names of the raw files and their associated, uncurated git commit-ids

Makefile: Builds the collated dataset and automates some of the other script running.
- Targets:
    - compile: Builds the collated dataset and fills in the appropriate NJ accessions.
    - fill_accession: Fills in the appropriate NJ accession using a map file.
    - collate: Builds the collated dataset from the original spreadsheet files.
    - subset: Takes a random subset from the large collated dataset file.
	- find_differences: Finds the differences between the compiled curated dataset constructed by Jenny Bolivar and the raw collated set derived from the original datafiles, and outputs to a file with color formatting indicating the differences.
	- copy_fixes_201[12]: Backcopies a curated collated file back into the original dataset (this was only done because we started by curating the Data-combined-collated-201[1234].xlsx rather than curating the original datafiles.
	- diff_spreadsheets_201[12]: Generates a raw spreadsheet differentials. 
    - find_raw_differences: Finds all the raw differences between the original, uncurated raw phenotype files and hand-curated phenotype files.
