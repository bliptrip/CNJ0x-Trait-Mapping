- Modify model regression code to estimate BLUPS within a year and using row/column spline, per Giovanny's email
suggestion.
- Modify drawcircos.js to use a class to isolate independent instances of invoking a circos plot, for the purpose of
presenting multiple different circos plots in a slideshow.
- Modify drawcircos.js to specify parameters such a label and karyotype radial offsets through parameters passed to
class constructor for circos.  Consider modifying Circos.js to allow for opening up the ring for better label insertion.
Also see if can build in features such as assigning classes to certain datasets that are plotted on tracks, in order
to allow for plugging in callback functions, etc -- to hide elements, etc, more seamlessly.  Also, this could be
extended to apply filters for only displaying certain subsets of data on tracks, etc.
- A lot of the trait correlation plots, etc., should be shifted to the workflow folders to reflect the fact that
different workflows may want to display/highlight different datasets.
